### Key Components & Features

1. **Guide System**:
   - Dynamic guide viewer with complete content for CIN compliance, tourist tax, and overbooking prevention
   - Categorized guides (taxes, calendars, overbooking, pricing, regulations)
   - Real content available for `cin-2025`, `tassa-soggiorno-2025`, `checkin-normative-2025`, and `overbooking-guida`

2. **Tools Integration**:
   - Tourist tax calculator (embedded iframe: `https://tassa-soggiorno-calculator.vercel.app`)
   - Anti-overbooking checker (embedded iframe: `https://overbooking-shield-tool.vercel.app/`)
   - Centralized in `ToolsUnifiedSection.jsx` component

3. **Service Sections**:
   - Landing page creation service for direct bookings
   - Future tools development (pricing analytics, competitor checking, multi-platform pricing)

4. **Contact & Forms**:
   - EmailJS integration for contact forms (@emailjs/browser 4.4.1)
   - Service ID: `service_kj88jdm`, Template ID: `template_wifuco4`
   - Toast notification system for user feedback
   - CIN support form with event-driven opening via custom window events

5. **Theme System**:
   - Dark/light mode toggle with ThemeContext provider
   - localStorage persistence for theme preferences (key: `ospitly-theme`)
   - System preference detection on first load using `prefers-color-scheme`
   - Tailwind dark mode classes integration (class-based strategy)

### Styling & Design System

**Tailwind Configuration**:
- Primary color: `#EF7E23` (orange)
- Secondary color: `#22D212` (green)
- Custom font: Inter with sans-serif fallback
- Content paths: `./index.html`, `./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}`
- PostCSS integration through Vite config for optimized builds
- Dark mode: class-based strategy (`darkMode: 'class'`) for theme toggling
- Extra small breakpoint: `xs: 480px`

**Design Patterns**:
- Gradient backgrounds for hero sections
- Card-based layouts with hover effects (hover:-translate-y-1, hover:scale-105)
- Responsive grid systems (md:grid-cols-2, lg:grid-cols-3)
- Color-coded difficulty levels (green/yellow/red for easy/intermediate/advanced)

### Italian Hospitality Domain Knowledge

The application contains detailed, current information about:

- **CIN (Codice Identificativo Nazionale)**: Mandatory from January 1, 2025, with penalties €800-8,000
- **Tourist Tax Rates 2025**: Milan €7 (4-5 stars), Rome €7.50, Naples €6
- **Overbooking Prevention**: 83% of hosts experience overbooking, costing €200-500 per incident
- **Calendar Synchronization**: .ics file management across platforms (Airbnb, Booking.com, Expedia)

## State Management Pattern

### Simple React State Architecture
- **Guide Navigation**: React state in `App.jsx` using `useState` for current guide
- **Conditional Rendering**: Toggle between main landing page and full-screen guide viewer
- **Props Flow**: Guide selection passed down via `onGuideClick` prop to `GuidesSection`
- **Navigation**: Back navigation handled via `onBack` callback in `GuideViewer`
- **Event System**: Custom window events for CIN form opening (`openCinForm` event)
- **Theme Management**: Context-based theme provider with `useTheme` hook

### Data Flow Example
```
App.jsx (state: currentGuide, isCinFormOpen)
  ├─> GuidesSection (onGuideClick callback)
  ├─> GuideViewer (guide prop, onBack callback)
  └─> ContactForm (isOpen, onClose, showToast props)
```

## Development Guidelines

### Component Architecture
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind breakpoints
- Follow the established color scheme (primary/secondary) with gradients
- Include hover states, transforms, and smooth transitions for interactive elements
- Organize components by function (layout, sections, guides, ui, forms, contexts)
- Wrap theme-dependent components with ThemeProvider from `ThemeContext`

### Content Management
- Guide content is stored in `src/data/guideContent.jsx` (centralized)
- Real guides use JSX content with structured sections
- Sources are provided for credibility and compliance
- Email links use pre-filled subject/body for better UX

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy load embedded iframes
- Use Framer Motion for smooth animations with intersection observer patterns
- FadeInOnScroll components use `useInView` hook with `-100px` margin for early triggering
- Animation components support direction (up/down/left/right), stagger delays, and custom durations
- Implement proper image optimization (logo assets in /public)
- Maintain fast build times with Vite

### SEO & Accessibility
- React Helmet Async for meta tags management
- Semantic HTML structure
- Proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)
- Alt text for images and meaningful link text

## Code Quality Standards

- **ESLint**: Modern flat config with JSX support and browser globals
- **Lint rules**: Uppercase constants allowed (varsIgnorePattern: '^[A-Z_]'), no unused variables
- **React**: Hooks and refresh plugins enabled for optimal development experience
- **JavaScript**: ECMAScript 2020+ features, module-based imports/exports
- **Configuration files**: All use ES modules (.js with `type: "module"` in package.json)

## External Integrations

- **EmailJS**: Used for contact forms (@emailjs/browser 4.4.1). Configuration in `src/components/sections/ToolsUnifiedSection.jsx` and `src/components/forms/ContactForm.jsx`
- Contact email: `info@ospitly.it`

### External Tools
- Calculator iframe: `https://tassa-soggiorno-calculator.vercel.app`
- Anti-overbooking tool: `https://overbooking-shield-tool.vercel.app/`
- Future tools: Dashboard analytics, competitor pricing, multi-platform optimization

## Business Context

The application serves Italian hospitality hosts dealing with:
- Complex tax calculations across different cities
- Platform management (Airbnb, Booking.com, Expedia)
- Regulatory compliance (CIN, tourist tax, guest registration)
- Revenue optimization through direct bookings

Target users are accommodation hosts who need reliable tools and current regulatory information to manage their properties effectively.

## Animation System

The project uses a custom animation wrapper built on Framer Motion:

- **FadeInOnScroll**: Main component for scroll-triggered fade animations
  - Props: `direction` (up/down/left/right/none), `delay`, `duration`, `once`
  - Uses intersection observer with `-100px` margin for early triggering
  - Custom easing: `[0.25, 0.4, 0.25, 1]`

- **FadeInStagger**: Container for staggered children animations
  - Props: `staggerDelay` (default 0.1s between children)
  - Automatically coordinates child animation timing

- **FadeInStaggerItem**: Individual items within staggered animations
  - Used as children of `FadeInStagger`
  - Supports `direction` prop for animation direction

Usage pattern in sections:
```jsx
<FadeInOnScroll direction="up" delay={0.3}>
  <h2>Title</h2>
</FadeInOnScroll>

<FadeInStagger staggerDelay={0.2}>
  {items.map(item => (
    <FadeInStaggerItem key={item.id}>
      <Card {...item} />
    </FadeInStaggerItem>
  ))}
</FadeInStagger>
```

## Development Roadmap

See **TODO.md** for the complete prioritized task list with detailed implementation examples.

**Recently Completed**:
- ✅ Toast System Bug Fix (inline `<style jsx>` moved to index.css)
- ✅ Error Boundaries (added to prevent app crashes)
- ✅ Form Validation (custom validation with error feedback in ContactForm)

**Current Focus**:
- SEO Meta Tags (Open Graph, Twitter Cards, JSON-LD schemas)
- Scroll Behavior optimization (refactor nested setTimeout)
- Code splitting for GuideViewer and ContactForm

**Future Priorities**:
- Testing setup (Vitest + React Testing Library)
- EmailJS rate limiting (prevent spam)
- Accessibility improvements (ARIA, focus management)
- Image optimization (WebP format, lazy loading)

Refer to TODO.md for time estimates and detailed code examples for each task.
